# supported providers: StaticJSON and DynamicJSON.

# StaticJSON reads a JSON file configured by the flag vendordata_jsonfile_path
# and places the JSON from that file into vendor_data.json and
# vendor_data2.json.
#
# DynamicJSON is configured via the vendordata_dynamic_targets flag, which is
# documented separately. For each of the endpoints specified in that flag, a
# section is added to the vendor_data2.json.

# Scheduler weight classes
#
# Weigher classes the cells scheduler should use. An entry of
# "nova.cells.weights.all_weighers" maps to all cell weighers
# included with nova. As of the Mitaka release the following
# weight classes are available:
#
# mute_child: Downgrades the likelihood of child cells being
# chosen for scheduling requests, which haven't sent capacity
# or capability updates in a while. Options include
# mute_weight_multiplier (multiplier for mute children; value
# should be negative).
#
# ram_by_instance_type: Select cells with the most RAM capacity
# for the instance type being requested. Because higher weights
# win, Compute returns the number of available units for the
# instance type requested. The ram_weight_multiplier option defaults
# to 10.0 that adds to the weight by a factor of 10. Use a negative
# number to stack VMs on one host instead of spreading out new VMs
# to more hosts in the cell.
#
# weight_offset: Allows modifying the database to weight a particular
# cell. The highest weight will be the first cell to be scheduled for
# launching an instance. When the weight_offset of a cell is set to 0,
# it is unlikely to be picked but it could be picked if other cells
# have a lower weight, like if they're full. And when the weight_offset
# is set to a very high value (for example, '999999999999999'), it is
# likely to be picked if another cell do not have a higher weight.

# follows:
#
#     * Greater than 1.0: increases the effect of the metric on overall weight.
#
#     * Equal to 1.0: No change to the calculated weight.
#
#     * Less than 1.0, greater than 0: reduces the effect of the metric on
#     overall weight.
#
#     * 0: The metric value is ignored, and the value of the
#     'weight_of_unavailable' option is returned instead.
#
#     * Greater than -1.0, less than 0: the effect is reduced and reversed.
#
#     * -1.0: the effect is reversed
#
#     * Less than -1.0: the effect is increased proportionally and reversed.
#
# Valid values are numeric, either integer or float.

# metric.
#
# Note that if the ratio is set to 0, the metric value is ignored, and instead
# the weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.
#
# As an example, let's consider the case where this option is set to:
#
#     ``name1=1.0, name2=-1.3``

# The final weight will be:

# Number of seconds to wait for agent's reply to a request.
#
# Nova configures/performs certain administrative actions on a server with the
# help of an agent that's installed on the server. The communication between
# Nova and the agent is achieved via sharing messages, called records, over
# xenstore, a shared storage across all the domains on a Xenserver host.
# Operations performed by the agent on behalf of nova are: 'version',' key_init',
# 'password','resetnetwork','inject_file', and 'agentupdate'.
#
# To perform one of the above operations, the xapi 'agent' plugin writes the
# command and its associated parameters to a certain location known to the domain
# and awaits response. On being notified of the message, the agent performs
# appropriate actions on the server and writes the result back to xenstore. This
# result is then read by the xapi 'agent' plugin to determine the success/failure
# of the operation.
#
# This config option determines how long the xapi 'agent' plugin shall wait to
# read the response off of xenstore for a given request/command. If the agent on

# When adding new host to a pool, this will append a --force flag to the

# features it uses to determine CPU compatibility to only the ones that are
